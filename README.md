SpacemeshTester.sikuli

This small and badly written Sikulix script makes transactions on Spacemesh using Sikulix.

You will need the Spacemesh Gui and Sikulix installed to use this test script.

At startup, it provides three dialogs for where to send, how many transactions, and how long to pause each transaction.

If you fail to set a destination Spacemesh address, it will send to me, so don't leave that dialog empty!
